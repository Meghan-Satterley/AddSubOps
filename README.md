# AddSubOps
coded in x86 assembly language
This program implements specific addition and subtraction operations for different bit sizes on all registers

The following directions where given:
1) add three predefined numbers together and store in bSum
2) Subtract the first number from the sum of the second and third number. Store the results in bDiff.
3) add bSum and bDiff. Store the results in bResult.
Repeat this process for similarly-named WORD and DWORD operands
Use only the MOV, ADD, and SUB commands in the appropriate registers to manipulate data.
Finally move all results to the 32 bit register in order to add them all together. Store the results in dwTotal.

In order to run this code you will need to download the following zip files:\ 
masm615.zip
Irvine.zip
and store them in the C drive of your device.
